##Project Description 
# A Job Search Platform for Africa's Talent - AFRO-TALANTA 911 APP

Youth are Africa’s greatest asset and make up 37% of the working-age population in Africa.

In 2017, The Africa Competitiveness Report released by the World Economic Forum, the African Development Bank, and the World Bank Group, kicked off with these words: “Looking ahead, the continent’s young and increasing population presents an unprecedented opportunity to spur rapid development, a growing labor force and a large and emerging consumer market hold the promise of significant growth opportunities.

But today, the majority of youth in Africa do not have stable economic opportunities. In Africa, our youth unemployment rate sits at around 60% meaning the vast numbers of its young population are unemployed. Its young people face underemployment and lack of opportunities without access to the internet and the lack of information about any opportunities. Consequently, there is an urgent need to create opportunities for youth, with tremendous potential impact.

Afro-Talanta 911 App aspires to drive positive economic and social growth in Africa by providing a global trusted digital platform through which individuals, organisations and institutions across the world interact and partner with Africa.

Welcome to Afro-Talanta 911 App is a home-grown web-based solution that offers a vital linkage to bridge and narrow the talent gap in Africa. Job seekers use job boards to search for new local and global opportunities.

Afro-Talanta 911 App aims to help an African job seeker to search for new job opportunities in their area and profession from this online job board. Also this is a valuable app for recruiters and hiring managers aiming to attract and find new talent.
